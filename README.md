# STATE-OF-MATTER

  This is just a basic python code showing how you can make a website using flask and it's common functions. In this case, I made a website discussing Matter and it's different states.
  
  Steps:
  
   *Make sure that you have flask installed in your Pythond Environment.*
 
    1. Download the entire folder called State of Matter.
    2. Run main.py using CMD.
    3. Access the home page by typing "http://127.0.0.1:5000/" on your preferred browser.
    4. Use the navbar to navigate different webpages.
  
  Note: If you are going to modify this code, make sure that you keep the folder structure identical because flask requires having css and images in "static" folder and the html files in "template" folder.
